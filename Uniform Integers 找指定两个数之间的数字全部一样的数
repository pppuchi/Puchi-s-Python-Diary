A positive integer is considered uniform if all of its digits are equal. For example, 222222 is uniform, while 223223 is not.
Given two positive integers A and B, determine the number of uniform integers between A and B, inclusive.
Please take care to write a solution which runs within the time limit.
Constraints
1≤A≤B≤10**12


# Write any import statements here

def getUniformIntegerCountInInterval(A: int, B: int) -> int:
  # Write your code here
  k=0
  L=[]
  
  for i in range(len(str(B))):
    k+=10**i
    for j in range(1,10):
      if A<=k*j<=B:
        L.append(k*j)
        
  return len(L)
